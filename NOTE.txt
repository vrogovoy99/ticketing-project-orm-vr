1. Sequence of development:

1.1. Controllers are build
1.2. Controllers call ServiceImpl via Service interface
1.3. ServiceImpl call Repository interface (to utilize JPArepository library)
1.4. ServiceImpl utilizes ModelMapper to conver entity to DTO objects.
1.5. Mapper bean is created in Main application run class.


Controller -> Service Interface -> ServiceImpl -> Repository + Mappers

        @Where(clause = "is_deleted=false")
